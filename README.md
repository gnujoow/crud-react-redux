# CR<del>U</del>D React with redux

Simple implementation CRUD using React & Redux. This project has been carried out while taking to [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/). I'm not familiar with node.js so I forked [this repository](ReduxSimpleStarter) and wrote the code. and wrote the codes.

I used [this site](http://reduxblog.herokuapp.com/) as API server. And you can check project dependency in this [file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gnujoow/crud-react-redux/master/package.json).
